This program is a ticket registration system designed to facilitate the purchase of 
tickets for various movies. Users can input their first name, last name, email, 
phone number, select a movie from a dropdown menu, and specify the quantity of 
tickets they wish to purchase.

The inputs are validated to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly
before a ticket purchase is processed. Upon submission, the ticket information is 
stored as objects in an array.

Users can view all purchased tickets, including details such as name, email, phone number,
selected movie, and ticket quantity. Additionally, there is functionality to clear all 
tickets from the list. The program utilizes JavaScript for input validation, 
ticket registration, and rendering ticket information on the webpage.
